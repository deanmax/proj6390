All log files have timestamp listed as their first column in each line of 
messages.

In DV message, if a hop count is denoted by 10, then the corresponding next 
hop router id will also be marked as 10(which actually doesn't exist).

All Files (hinX, houtX, routX and lanX) will be created by host and router 
processes. Controller processer only do checking and copying stuff. 
*BUT* controller will update timestamp of each message.
