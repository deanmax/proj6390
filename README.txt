# All commands in this project are Perl script. They are self-explanatory which do not need compilation process. Just simple execute them.

# All log files have timestamp(message generate time) listed as their first column in each line of messages.

# In DV message, if a hop count is denoted by 10, then the corresponding next hop router id will also be marked as 10(which actually doesn't exist).

# All Files (hinX, houtX, routX and lanX) will be created by host and router processes. Controller processer only do checking and copying stuff.

# During system simulation, routers and lans are fixed, which means no more routers or lans can be added dynamically. However, hosts can be added after system starts.(This applies to script test6.sh)
